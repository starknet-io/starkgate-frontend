## Reporting issues

When reporting an issue, please make sure you include the version used.

This might help you diagnose the issue yourself, if not, paste the results along with your report.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Please do not file big Pull Requests. It makes reviewing and ensuring correctness difficult. If possible, break it down in smaller commits/pulls, each related to a specific issue or subject
- Every commit should have a meaningful subject
- If the code has tests, they must pass before submitting the pull request
- When submitting a new feature, unit tests must be submitted as well
- Whenever possible, implement features as plugins, not by modifying Core code
- Always keep performance in mind
- If you are unsure about submitting a Pull request, ask one of the repository owners for clarification

## Submitting Pull-Requests

1. Fork the default branch of the relevant repo
2. Create a branch with a meaningful name; i.e - some-feature-name-fix
3. Commit and make a pull request
