          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          On the Site, you will have the ability via the Interface to access the Bridge. More
          information about the Bridge is available{' '}

        <p>
          <i>Decentralized Protocol</i>: The Bridge is a pair of decentralized smart contracts, one
          running on the Ethereum blockchain and the other on Starknet. The Interface provides an
          Interface to access the Bridge in a user-friendly manner, [however due to its
          decentralized nature StarkWare does not control the Bridge1]. The Bridge is non-custodial.
          StarkWare does not have any ability to control or modify how you conduct transactions on
          Ethereum or Starknet. By using the Bridge, you acknowledge and recognize that use of the
          Bridge is at your own risk and will be subject to the rules encoded within the Bridge,
          including as to when and on what terms and at which speed your transactions are conducted
          on Ethereum and/or Starknet, neither of which StarkWare can influence or fully control.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Risk Disclosures Relating to Blockchain</i>. By utilizing the Bridge, you represent
          that you understand the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency systems; and warrant
          that you have an understanding of the usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens,
          digital assets, blockchains and other distributed and decentralized systems, and smart
          contracts. In particular, you are aware and recognize that any transactions conducted on a
          blockchain cannot be undone or reversed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Information</i>. The site may contain information regarding the Bridge or particular
          instances of the Bridge. Such information is provided for informational purposes only,
          without any representation or warranty. StarkWare does not assume any responsibility or
          liability for the accuracy or inaccuracy of any such information. Before acting upon or
          making any decisions on the basis of such information, you are responsible to
          independently verify such information.

        <p>
          <i>Fees</i>. StarkWare reserves the right to charge fees for use of the bridge , and in
          such case shall display to you any applicable fees prior to you incurring the fee. There
          are fees and costs associated with using the Bridge, a description of which can be found{' '}

          <i>We are not responsible for any loss</i>: The Bridge, Starknet and other blockchain
          networks are decentralized systems that are still under active development, and therefore:
          (a) may contain bugs, errors and defects, (b) may function improperly or be subject to
          periods of downtime and unavailability, (c) may result in total or partial loss or
          corruption of cryptocurrencies with respect to which they are used and/or data, (d) may be
          modified at any time, including through the release of subsequent versions, all with or
          without notice to you, or (e) may have security vulnerabilities and be subject to hacking.
          StarkWare will not be liable or responsible for any losses or damages to you, including
          without limitation any loss of funds on Ethereum and/or Starknet with which you conduct
          your transactions using the Bridge, as a result of any of the foregoing.
